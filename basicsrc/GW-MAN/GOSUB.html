<h1>GOSUB ... RETURN Statement</h1>
<h4>Purpose:</h4>
<p>To branch to, and return from, a subroutine.</p>
<h4>Syntax:</h4>
<pre><b>GOSUB</b> <i>line number</i>
<b>.</b>
<b>.</b>
<b>.</b>
<b>RETURN</b> [<i>line number</i>]</pre>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p><span class="code"><i>line number</i></span> is the first line number of the subroutine.</p>
<p>A subroutine may be called any number of times in a program, and a subroutine may be called from within another subroutine. Such nesting of subroutines is limited only by available memory.</p>
<p>A <span class="code">RETURN</span> statement in a subroutine causes GW-BASIC to return to the statement following the most recent <span class="code">GOSUB</span> statement. A subroutine can contain more than one <span class="code">RETURN</span> statement, should logic dictate a <span class="code">RETURN</span> at different points in the subroutine.</p>
<p>Subroutines can appear anywhere in the program, but must be readily distinguishable from the main program.</p>
<p>To prevent inadvertent entry, precede the subroutine by a <span class="code">STOP</span>, <span class="code">END</span>, or <span class="code">GOTO</span> statement to direct program control around the subroutine.</p>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<pre>10 GOSUB 40
20 PRINT &quot;BACK FROM SUBROUTINE&quot;
30 END
40 PRINT &quot;SUBROUTINE&quot;;
50 PRINT &quot; IN&quot;;
60 PRINT &quot; PROGRESS&quot;
70 RETURN
RUN
 SUBROUTINE IN PROGRESS
 BACK FROM SUBROUTINE</pre>
<p>The <span class="code">END</span> statement in line 30 prevents re-execution of the subroutine.</p>
