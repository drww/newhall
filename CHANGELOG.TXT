Newhall 1.4.7
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed behavior when dealing with waterholding capacity and also the soil-
  air offsets.  The fields can now be nullable.  
* The Flerry connector now only uses the parameter whc and offset if the XML 
  file has null values for either of these fields.  
* 200.0mm is assumed now for CSV inputs.  This is being set when the dataset
  is being assembled instead of the assumed default by the GUI.
* The GUI now reads the whc from the file, and initializes the model using it
  instead of the default of 200.0mm. 

Newhall 1.4.6
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed an error in the Aridic and Xeric subgroup modifier determiniation
  logic that deviated from the BASIC model's code.  Unit tests for Pendleton
  and Chadron have been added to test that these changes are correct.

Newhall 1.4.5
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a problem with the temperature calendar not being generated when
  a dataset has no months where air temperature is at or below 8 degrees
  Celsius.

Newhall 1.4.4
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a problem with negative decimal degrees for latitude being reported
  to the model, which is accustomed to positive degrees only.  All DD figures
  in the XML file formats are now converted into positive degrees and will
  toggle between N/S and E/W hemispheres.

Newhall 1.4.3
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a problem in the simulation model for the determination of the subgroup
  modifier.  Portions of the model were not properly translated.
  * Williamsport '72 dataset demonstrates this bug.
  * More varied unit testing is required and will be present in future versions.
* Created and populated a changelog based on project SVN history.

Newhall 1.4.2
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed some redundant calls to the model when UI events are triggered.
* Replaced all instances of the word "degrees" with the ASCII degree symbol.
* Fixed all variations between the XML file and XML string parsers.
* Moved <srcunitsys> out of the <input> tag and into the <metadata> tag.

Newhall 1.4.1
------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed problems with API due to reflection ambiguity when using Flerry as a
  connector to Flex.  Flerry does not respect inheritence in object data types,
  so four explicit API invocation combinations were created.
* Removed explicit typing on <srcunitsys> tag.
* Started to replace the word "degrees" with degree symbols.
* Fixed some variations between XML file and string parsers.  More probably exist.

Newhall 1.4.0
------------------------------------------------------
* JUnit tests added for simulation model.
  * Only variances observed at present are due to the increased resolution of
    the floating point numbers vs. the original BASIC model.  This may cause at
    most a single day variance in the calendars and results.
* Added <nettype> tag to <metadata> parent tag.
* Added <srcunitsys> tag.
* Cleaned up a lot of old debug statements, replaced them with more relevant ones.
* XML file format is now forced to be in Metric.

Newhall 1.3.1
------------------------------------------------------
* Flerry connector alterations due to data typing.  Using primitive wrapper
  classes for parameters, since Flerry will not handle primitive types.

Newhall 1.3.0
------------------------------------------------------
* New manual replaces prior quickstart guide.
* Adding quick JAR assembly scripts for both *nix and Windows.
* Altered copyright parties in LICENSE file.
* <subgrpmod> tag added to XML file under <output> parent tag.

Newhall 1.2.x
------------------------------------------------------
* Added soil temperature calculations based on a hybrid of the C++ version's 
  algorithm and the assumptions made in the BASIC model.
* Soil-air offset and amplitude relationships added.
* Modified model to take either custom soil-air relationships or defaults.
* Flerry integration API added.
* UI tweaks and fixes.

Newhall 1.1.x
------------------------------------------------------
* Moisture and temperature calendars fixed.
* XML file export completely implemented.
* Converted UI into a tabbed layout.
* Added JDOM dependency for XML file handling.
* Moved from Ant to Maven build system.
* Added application-wide rounding to two decimal places.
* New "About" dialog.
* Added UI panes for metadata.
* Lots of internal reworking for handling metadata.
* UI tweaks and fixes.

Newhall 1.0.x
------------------------------------------------------
* Initial release.
* Ported BASIC model to Java with simple GUI to feed legacy data into to run.
