connect a printer to the parallel port of the computer and make it ready. 
GWBasic being DOS based program, it can recognize only the parallel port and not the serial ports or USB ports.

Open GWBasic
Type out a program 
Give the list command - this will print the lines on the screen
Now give the LLIst command - the lines will be printed in the printer

If your program output is to be sent to screen , you can use the print command in the GWBasic program.
But if your program has to send the output to a printer, use lprint command with in the program.
Only when you give the run command(or when the program is run), the lprint will go into action.

Another way to print the code in printer is as follows:
1. Save the code as a file , say file1.bas
2.Type the system command and get out of GWBasic and come to DOS prompt.
3. Now give the dos command - type file1.bas>prn
prn in dos means the parallel port printer and the lines will be typed in printer.
This method does not use GWBasic commands, but Dos commands for printing the code.This can be used for code printing and not for printing the output of the program.

OR JUST USE:

load"PROGRAM"
list,"PROGRAM.TXT"
