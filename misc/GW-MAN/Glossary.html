  <dt>single-precision value</dt>
  <dd>The number of words or storage positions used to denote a number in a computer. Single-precision arithmetic is the use of one word per number; double-precision arithmetic is the use of two words per number, and so on. For variable word-length computers, precision is the number of digits used to denote a number. The higher the precision, the greater the number of decimal places that can be carried.</dd>
  <dt>single-sided</dt>
  <dd>A term used to describe a diskette that contains data on one side only.</dd>
  <dt>software</dt>
  <dd>A string of instructions that, when executed, direct the computer to perform certain functions.</dd>
  <dt>stack architecture</dt>
  <dd>An architecture wherein any portion of the external memory can be used as a last-in, first-out stack to store/retrieve the contents of the accumulator, the flags, or any of the data registers. Many units contain a 16-bit stack pointer to control the addressing of this external stack. One of the major advantages of the stack is that multiple-level interrupts can be handled easily, since complete system status can be saved when an interrupt occurs and then be restored after the interrupt. Another major advantage is that almost unlimited subroutine nesting is possible.</dd>
  <dt>statement</dt>
  <dd>A high-level language instruction to the computer to perform some sequence of operations.</dd>
  <dt>synchronous</dt>
  <dd>A type of computer operation in which the execution of each instruction or each event is controlled by a clock signal: evenly spaced pulses that enable the logic gates for the execution of each logic step. A synchronous operation can cause time delays by causing waiting for clock signals although all other signals at a particular logic gate were available. See <i>asynchronous</i>.</dd>
  <dt>switch</dt>
  <dd>An instruction, added to a command, that designates a course of action, other than default, for the command process to follow.</dd>
  <dt>syntax</dt>
  <dd>Rules of statement structure in a programming language.</dd>
  <dt>system</dt>
  <dd>A collection of hardware, software, and firmware that is interconnected to operate as a unit.</dd>
  <dt>task</dt>
  <dd>A machine run; a program in execution.</dd>
  <dt>toggle</dt>
  <dd>Alternation of function between two stable states.</dd>
  <dt>track</dt>
  <dd>A specific area on a moving-storage medium, such as a diskette, disk, or tape cartridge, that can be accessed by the drive heads.</dd>
  <dt>tree-structured directory</dt>
  <dd>A file-organization structure, consisting of directories and subdirectories that, when diagrammed, resembles a tree.</dd>
  <dt>truncation</dt>
  <dd>To end a computation according to a specified rule; for example, to drop numbers at the end of a line instead of rounding them off, or to drop characters at the end of a line when a file is copied.</dd>
  <dt>upgrade</dt>
  <dd>To expand a system by installing options or using revised software.</dd>
  <dt>utility function</dt>
  <dd>Computer programs, dedicated to one particular task, that are helpful in using the computer. For example, FDISK, for setting up partitions on the fixed disk.</dd>
  <dt>variable</dt>
  <dd>A quantity that can assume any of a set of values as a result of processing data.</dd>
  <dt>volume label</dt>
  <dd>The name for the contents of a diskette or a partition on a fixed disk.</dd>
  <dt>word</dt>
  <dd>The set of bits comprising the largest unit that the computer can handle in a single operation.</dd>
  <dt>write-protect notch</dt>
  <dd>A cut-out opening in the sealed envelope of a diskette that, when covered, prevents writing or adding text to the diskette, but allows information to be read from the diskette.</dd>
