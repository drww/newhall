<h1>Appendix F<br>Communications</h1>
<p>This appendix describes the GW-BASIC statements necessary to support RS-232 asynchronous communications with other computers and peripheral devices.<br>
</p>

<h2>F.1 Opening Communications Files</h2>
<p>The <span class="code">OPEN COM</span> statement allocates a buffer for input and output in the same manner as the <span class="code">OPEN</span> statement opens disk files.<br>
</p>

<h2>F.2 Communications I/O</h2>
<p>Since the communications port is opened as a file, all I/O statements valid for disk files are valid for COM.</p>
<p>COM sequential input statements are the same as those for disk files:</p>
<pre>INPUT#
LINE INPUT#
INPUT$ </pre>
<p>COM sequential output statements are the same as those for diskette:</p>
<pre>PRINT#
PRINT# USING</pre>
<p>See the <i>GW-BASIC User's Reference</i> for more information on these statements.<br>
</p>

<h2>F.3 The COM I/O Functions</h2>
<p>The most difficult aspect of asynchronous communications is processing characters as quickly as they are received. At rates above 2400 baud (bps), it is necessary to suspend character transmission from the host long enough for the receiver to catch up. This can be done by sending XOFF (<span class="smallcaps">CTRL-S</span>) to the host to temporarily suspend transmission, and XON (<span class="smallcaps">CTRL-Q</span>) to resume, if the application supports it.</p>
<p>GW-BASIC provides three functions which help to determine when an overrun condition is imminent:</p>
<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3>
  <tr>
    <td width=72 valign=top class="code">LOC(<i>x</i>)</td>
    <td>Returns the number of characters in the input queue waiting to be read. The input queue can hold more than 255 characters (determined by the /<b>c</b>: switch). If there are more than 255 characters in the queue, <span class="code">LOC(<i>x</i>)</span> returns 255. Since a string is limited to 255 characters, this practical limit alleviates the need for the programmer to test for string size before reading data into it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top><span class="code">LOF(<i>x</i>)</span></td>
    <td><p>Returns the amount of free space in the input queue; that is</p>
      <pre><b>/c</b>:(<i>size</i>)-number of characters in the input queue</pre>
      <span class="code">LOF</span> may be used to detect when the input queue is reaching storage capacity.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top class="code">EOF(<i>x</i>)</td>
    <td>True (-1), indicates that the input queue is empty. False (0) is returned if any characters are waiting to be read.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

<h2>F.4 Possible Errors:</h2>
<p>A &quot;<span class="code">Communications buffer overflow</span>&quot; error occurs if a read is attempted after the input queue is full (that is, <span class="code">LOC(<i>x</i>)</span> returns 0).</p>
<p>A &quot;<span class="code">Device I/O</span>&quot; error occurs if any of the following line conditions are detected on receive: overrun error (OE), framing error (FE), or break interrupt (BI). The error is reset by subsequent inputs, but the character causing the error is lost.</p>
<p>A &quot;<span class="code">Device fault</span>&quot; error occurs if data set ready (DSR) is lost during I/O.</p>
<p>A &quot;<span class="code">Parity error</span>&quot; occurs if the PE (parity enable) option was used in the <span class="code">OPEN COM</span> statement and incorrect parity was received.<br>
</p>

<h2>F.5 The INPUT$ Function</h2>
<p>The <span class="code">INPUT$</span> function is preferred over the <span class="code">INPUT</span> and <span class="code">LINE INPUT</span> statements for reading COM files, because all ASCII characters may be significant in communications. <span class="code">INPUT</span> is least desirable because input stops when a comma or an enter is seen. <span class="code">LINE INPUT</span> terminates when an enter is seen.</p>
<p><span class="code">INPUT$</span> allows all characters read to be assigned to a string.</p>
<p><span class="code">INPUT$</span> returns <span class="code">x</span> characters from the <span class="code">y</span> file. The following statements then are most efficient for reading a COM file:</p>
<pre class=codepara>10 WHILE NOT EOF(1)
20 A$=INPUT$(LOC(1),#1)
30 ...
40 ... Process data returned in A$ ...
50 ...
60 WEND</pre>
<p>This sequence of statements translates: As long as something is in the input queue, return the number of characters in the queue and store them in A$. If there are more than 255 characters, only 255 are returned at a time to prevent string overflow. If this is the case, <span class="code">EOF(1)</span> is false, and input continues until the input queue is empty.<br>
</p>

<h3>GET and PUT Statements for COM Files</h3>
<h4>Purpose:</h4>
<p>To allow fixed-length I/O for COM.</p>
<h4>Syntax:</h4>
<pre><b>GET</b> <i>filenumber, nbytes</i> <b>PUT</b> <i>filenumber, nbytes</i></pre>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p><span class="code"><i>filenumber</i></span> is an integer expression returning a valid file number.</p>
<p><span class="code"><i>nbytes</i></span> is an integer expression returning the number of bytes to be transferred into or out of the file buffer. <span class="code"><i>nbytes</i></span> cannot exceed the value set by the <b>/s:</b> switch when GW-BASIC was invoked.</p>
<p>Because of the low performance associated with telephone line communications, it is recommended that <span class="code">GET</span> and <span class="code">PUT</span> not be used in such applications.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>The following TTY sample program is an exercise in communications I/O. It is designed to enable your computer to be used as a conventional terminal. Besides full-duplex communications with a host, the TTY program allows data to be downloaded to a file. Conversely, a file may be uploaded (transmitted) to another machine.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating the elements of asynchronous communications, this program is useful for transferring GW-BASIC programs and data to and from a computer.</p>
<hr>
<i><b><p>Note</p></b></i>
<p>This program is set up to communicate with a DEC® System-20 especially in the use of XON and XOFF. It may require modification to communicate with other types of hardware.</p>

<h2>F.7 Notes on the TTY Sample Program</h2>
<hr>
  <p><b><i>Note</i></b></p>
  <p><i>Asynchronous</i> implies character I/O as opposed to line or block I/O. Therefore, all prints (either to the COM file or screen) are terminated with a semicolon (;). This retards the return line feed normally issued at the end of the <span class="code">PRINT</span> statement.</p>
